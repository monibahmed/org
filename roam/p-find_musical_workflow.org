** Logic Pro X
*** Plugin Hosting
Quick key to show/hide plugins, but its all plugins. Can't customize based on track
** Ableton Live
*** Plugin Hosting
VST3 (Full), able to browse tracks and selectively arrange plugin windows
** Renoise
*** Effects
Effect hosting is track based, not instruments based, so you can have clean and effect sounds all together.
That means, that each track is separate DSP chain. Can't affect the whole chain. This is the same thing as Live track one affected and another unaffected. But Ableton only provides audio routing, Renoise does MIDI+Audio, so you can have multiple versions trigger off of different MIDI
